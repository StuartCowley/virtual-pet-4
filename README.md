This is a readme for the Virtual Pet Project as per the Software Engineer Fasttrack course at Manchester Codes.

At this stage, the read-me will be very bare, but I will update in due time as I move through the project.

From 16th December onwards, I will try to provide updates done on that day. Once I've finished, a more thorough read-me will be in place and I may move this to a journal-type file, but these updates should provide a better description of what's been done. One reason for this is the commit messages when committing to GitHub have to be rather brief.

Updates 16Dec2021: Previously, the pet object was empty. Now it contains a name, an age and the growUp function, which ages the pet 1 year when called. A few tests have also been written, asking whether the pet is an object, and whether that object has a name and age and whether the growUp function actually increases the age.

Updates 18Dec2021: Added fitness and hunger levels to the pet function, which also changes as a result of growUp(). Parameters are tested.
