Updates 16Dec2021: Previously, the pet object was empty. Now it contains a name, an age and the growUp function, which ages the pet 1 year when called. A few tests have also been written, asking whether the pet is an object, and whether that object has a name and age and whether the growUp function actually increases the age.

Updates 18Dec2021: Added fitness and hunger levels to the pet function, which also changes as a result of growUp(). Parameters are tested. Added walk() function, and ensured that fitness cannot pass above 10 when walk() is called. Added feed() function and ensured that hunger can't fall below 0 when feed() is called. Added a checkUp() function which checks the pet's fitness/hunger levels and changes the pet's mood accordingly.

Update 21Dec2021: Function is more or less finished. Death conditions have been set, along with the growUp(), walk() and feed() functions throwing an error if the pet dies (ie. guard clauses).

Update 31Dec2021: Function now has the ability to either have or adopt a baby, which is a new pet. Unfortunately, the pet seems to think that it's dead from the off, and I have no idea why this is. So I'm going to pass it onto code review anyway and ask what they think.

Update 06Jan2021: Function has been modified to move Pet.prototype{} to outside the pet function. This seems to have fixed the issue with the pet thinking it's dead when tested in node.
